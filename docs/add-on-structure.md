In previous versions of XF, there were very few standards and conventions surrounding add-on development. We have done 
a lot to change that in XF 2.0. Let's look at some of the changes:

## Add-on IDs and add-ons path

Each installed add-on must have a unique ID, and this ID dictates where on the filesystem that an add-on should store 
its files. There are two possible formats for an add-on ID.

The first "simple" type should be a single word and not contain any special characters. For example, `Demo`.

Simple add-on IDs must adhere to the following rules:

* Must only contain a-z or A-Z
* Can contain 0-9 but not at the start of the ID
* Can not contain any special characters such as slashes, dashes or underscores

The second contains a vendor prefix, so if you release add-ons under a specific brand or company, the add-on ID can 
indicate that. For example, `SomeVendor/Demo`.

The vendor type add-on ID should adhere to the following rules:

* Must only contain a-z or A-Z
* Can contain a single `/` character but not at the start or the end
* Can contain 0-9 but not at the start of either part of the add-on ID

Once you have decided what your add-on ID is, we know exactly where the files for this add-on will be stored. All XF 2.0 add-ons are stored within a subdirectory of the `src/addons` directory. 

If you have a simple add-on ID, e.g. `Demo`, the files for your add-on will be stored in the following location: 
 `src/addons/Demo`.
 
If you have a vendor based add-on ID, e.g. `SomeVendor/Demo`, the files will be stored in the following location: 
`src/addons/SomeVendor/Demo`.

The add-on ID you choose will also become your class namespace prefix (see [Namespaces](/general-concepts/#namespaces) for more information).

## Recommended version string format

XF itself uses a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH principle (e.g. 2.0.0 for the first stable XF2 release) to its version numbering and we recommend a similar approach is taken towards the versioning of your own add-ons. In basic terms, increment the

* MAJOR version when you make major feature changes, especially changes that break backwards compatibility
* MINOR version when you add functionality preferably in a backwards compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes

## Recommended version ID format

Version IDs for add-ons are basic integers which are used for internal version comparisons. It allows us to more easily detect when one version is older than another. Each version of your add-on should increase the version ID by at least 1, but a convention we use internally for XF itself, is potentially useful also for add-ons. Our version IDs are in the format of `aabbccde`.

* `aa` represents the major version
* `bb` represents the minor version
* `cc` represents the patch version
* `d` represents the state, e.g. `1` for alpha releases, `3` for beta releases, `5` for release candidates and `7` for stable releases
* `e` represents the state version

For example, an add-on with version string of 1.7.3 release candidate 4 would have an ID of `1070354`. The final stable release XF2 will have an ID of `2000070`. Version 1.5.0 Beta 3 of XF had an ID of `1050033`. Stable version 99.99.99 would have an ID of `99999970`... and maybe you should slow down a bit ðŸ˜‰

## Common add-on files and directories

There are a number of files and directories within an add-on's directory that have a special purpose and meaning.

### addon.json file

`addon.json` is a file which contains a number of pieces of information which are required to help XF 2.0 identify the 
add-on and display information about it in the Admin CP. At minimum, your `addon.json` file should look like this:

```json
{
    "title": "My Add-on by Some Company",
    "version_string": "2.0.0",
    "version_id": 2000070
}
```

A basic file will be created for you automatically when creating the add-on. It supports a lot more besides the example 
above, but we'll go into that in more detail later.

Including this file is mandatory.

### hashes.json file

`hashes.json` is the new way to add support for the File health check system, and the best part is -- it's generated 
automatically!

As part of the build process (more on that later) we will do a quick inventory of all your add-on's files and write the calculated hash of the file contents.

### Setup.php file

`Setup.php` is the new home for any code you require to run during install, upgrade or uninstallation of your add-on.

We will go into more detail about how to create a Setup class [below](#setup-class).

### _data directory

The `_data` directory is where the master data for your add-on is stored. Each add-on data type will have its own XML 
file (rather than a single one for all types). The hashes for these files are included inside `hashes.json` so we can 
ensure that an add-on has complete and consistent data before allowing an add-on to be installed.

### _output directory

The `_output` directory is not required for a successful installation of an add-on, and shouldn't be included when releasing the add-on. This directory is purely for development purposes and is only used if development mode is enabled (see [Enabling development mode](/development-tools/#enabling-development-mode)).

Each item of add-on data is stored in a separate file. Mostly they are stored as JSON files, but in the case of phrases they are stored as TXT files and for templates they are stored as HTML/CSS/LESS files. All template types are editable in the filesystem directly, and changes made to these files are written back to the database automatically on load.

## Setup class

To create a Setup class for your add-on, all you need to do is create a file named `Setup.php` in the root of your add-on directory.

The Setup class should extend `\XF\AddOn\AbstractSetup` which requires, at minimum, to implement `install()`, `upgrade()` and `uninstall()` methods. Here's what a simple add-on Setup class might look like:

```php
<?php

namespace Demo;

class Setup extends \XF\AddOn\AbstractSetup
{
	public function install(array $stepParams = [])
	{
		$this->schemaManager()->createTable('xf_demo', function(\XF\Db\Schema\Create $table)
		{
			$table->addColumn('demo_id', 'int');
		});
	}
	
	public function upgrade(array $stepParams = [])
	{
		if ($this->addOn->version_id < 1000170)
		{
			$this->schemaManager()->alterTable('xf_demo', function(\XF\Db\Schema\Alter $table)
			{
				$table->addColumn('foo', 'varchar', 10)->setDefault('');
			});
		}
	}
	
	public function uninstall(array $stepParams = [])
	{
		$this->schemaManager()->dropTable('xf_demo');
	}
}
```

The Setup class also supports running each of the actions in different steps. To implement this behavior your Setup class can use the `StepRunnerInstallTrait`, `StepRunnerUpgradeTrait` and/or `StepRunnerUninstallTrait` [traits](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.traits.php). These implement the required methods automatically, and you just need to add the relevant steps, e.g. `installStep1()`, `upgrade1000170Step1()`, `upgrade1000170Step2()` and `uninstallStep1()`, where `1000170` etc. in the upgrade methods are the add-on version IDs (see [Recommended version ID format](#recommended-version-id-format)).
